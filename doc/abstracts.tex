This manual explains how to use the {Spider} program to generate a
{\tt WEB} system for any programming language.
It describes the syntax of the {Spider} description file used to
describe a programming language, giving several examples.
It does not say how to use the generated {\tt WEB} system; for that
see ``The Spidery {\tt WEB} System of Structured Documentation.''

\centerline{The Spidery {\tt WEB} System of Structured Documentation}


This manual describes how to write programs in the {\tt WEB} language,
using {\tt WEB} systems generated by {Spider}.
Most of the material is taken verbatim from Donald Knuth's original
memo introducing {\tt WEB}.
It contains a brief introduction to the idea of literate programming,
a short explanation of how to run {\tt WEAVE} and {\tt TANGLE}, and a
list of all of the control sequences that can be used in {\tt WEB}
programs and their effects.
