 8 Apr 89	Forgot to move object files to $(OBDIR) when making `boot'
 8 Apr 89	TANGLE token numbers were too low by 3.  This caused a
		duplicate case in switch when there were too many tokens,
		because some token was getting decimal 10 (#'13).  The
		fix was to add 3 to the appropriate place in spider.web

10 Apr 89	Bad figure in cacm.tex
11 Apr 89	Make clean and distribution removed important source
		from master directory.
11 Apr 89	WEAVE itself doesn't WEAVE properly because of foul
		comments in grammar.web.  Changed spider.web to escape
		_ and # as well as |.
11 Apr 89	spiderwebman.tex had a missing \endnewstuff.  While
		putting it in I found some inaccuracies about macros.
		The whole spiderwebman is pretty grim, and should be
		rewritten, or at least checked for accuracy.

14 Apr 89	Removed @\ from WEAVE; it was already gone from TANGLE

26 Jun 89	Removed \eject from webkernel.tex line 221 (before first page)

20 Jul 89	WEAVE was erroneously matching scraps with category zero.
		This was tickled in ceeweave by the name @<Oink |#include|s@>.
		Grabbing the scrap with category zero caused WEAVE to drop
		the text associated with the whole sequence.  I don't know
		why it didn't go off the trolley entirely.
		Fix was to put in a zero check for negations (single and
		lists) and wild cards.

23 Jan 90	Got a letter from David Ness, indicating some changes for
